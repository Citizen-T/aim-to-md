# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project called "aim-to-md" set up as an IntelliJ IDEA module. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with only a Python virtual environment and IDE configuration files present.

## Development Environment

- **Language**: Python 3.9
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA with Python support
- **Virtual Environment**: Located in `.venv/` directory
- **Module Configuration**: Defined in `aim-to-md.iml`

## Project Structure

The repository currently contains minimal files:
- `aim-to-md.iml`: IntelliJ IDEA module configuration
- `.venv/`: Python virtual environment (excluded from version control)
- `.idea/`: IntelliJ IDEA project settings
- `.git/`: Git repository

## Development Setup

Since this is a Python project in its initial phase, typical development commands would be:

1. **Activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (when requirements file is added):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notes

- The project appears to be in early development with no source code files yet
- No build scripts, test frameworks, or dependency management files are currently present
- The `.venv` directory is properly excluded from the module content in the IntelliJ configuration
